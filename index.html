    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p align="justify">
BYJU’S Tuition Centres is an initiative of BYJU’S to propel quality education at affordable rates via easy accessibility. We have set up many BYJU’S Tuition Centres in different cities across India. While our aim is to provide tuition classes that help students score well in academics. We also prioritise the development of critical thinking and concept-building. It prepares our students with excellent problem-solving abilities required in competitive exams conducted outside schools. 
      <br><br>
We offer tuition classes in two of the most important subjects at school - Maths and Science. Since these two subjects need strategic teaching methods to explain concepts and develop skills related to problem-solving, we use a lot of advanced teaching aids that use high-end technology to present explanations of concepts and examples more visually. This helps our students learn various concepts in Science and Maths by relating those to easily observable phenomena in their daily lives
